# Some Generative Artworks

Foundations of Electronic Media • 60-120

---

Below are some online collections of generative artworks. In most cases, each page presents variations produced by a single piece of software-art.

> **Note 1.** Computer-based generative art has a long history extending back into the 1960s, but most of the examples below were created since 2022. Many were created using p5.js.

> **Note 2.**: Many of the artworks listed below are time-based and/or interactive, and some even allow you to generate new results beyond the ones already generated. For projects on the [fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) website, for example, look for the following buttons, which (if present) will allow you to experience some projects in real-time: <br />![fxhash.png](img/fxhash_ui.png)
