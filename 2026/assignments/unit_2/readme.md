## 2.1. Orientation

Before the end of class on February 4th/5th, please make sure to have done the following:

* If you don't already have one, **create** an account at OpenProcessing.org.
* In your laptop’s web browser, **bookmark** [our OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/104705#/), whose URL is [https://openprocessing.org/class/104705#/](https://openprocessing.org/class/104705#/).
* **Join** our OpenProcessing classroom. To do this, **login** to your OpenProcessing account.

*Now: (15 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

**Spend 15 minutes familiarizing yourself** with the following online resources. The goal here is simply to make sure you are *aware* of these media, that you know *where* to find them, and that you know *how* they can help you. *There is no deliverable for this exercise.*

* Here's a [p5.js **Cheat Sheet**](https://bmoren.github.io/p5js-cheat-sheet/)
* This is the official [p5.js **Reference**](https://p5js.org/reference/)) and the [older version](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/) that you might like better.
* Here are the [p5.js **Examples**](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/). I recommend you browse at least 5 of them.
* Here are some extremely helpful and important **YouTube tutorial channels**: 
  * The legendary [**Coding Train**](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/videos) by Dan Shiffman — featuring 1200+ videos, ranging from [this great p5.js introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) to very advanced tutorials
  * [PattVira](https://www.youtube.com/@pattvira) – excellent tutorials (by a CMU alum!), including this great [introductory playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0beHPVMklwgMz4Z-mNp4_udo9mjBk7pn)
  * [Xin Xin](https://www.youtube.com/@xinxin1011) — some more excellent introductory videos
* Of possible interest:
  * [p5.j​​s 中文教程](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEffNzLcn60&list=PLznBLb1-pQM_piONXfwND-0h3h493vO1k) by [QianQian Ye](https://qianqian-ye.com/)
  * [한국어로 된 p5.js 튜토리얼](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fbcQqzJzE&list=PLgAffhOqz2QE0o6TeDW345rcA_YBCDqnt)

## 2.2. Looking Outwards: Generative Art

![William Mapan (detail)](img/mapan.jpg)

*(45 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

> *“Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.”* — Philip Galanter

In this exercise, you'll look at some artworks, and make a brief post about one that caught your eye. *So:* 

* [**Here is a list**](some_generative_artworks.md) of about 50 generative artworks. **Browse** these pages, and **select** a project you like (or which appeals to you more than the others). 
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-2-looking-outwards`. In your post,
* **state** the project's title and artist;
* **provide** a link to the project's URL;
* **write** a sentence or two about what you found interesting about it; and
* **include** an image or screenshot of the artwork.

## 2.3. Reading-Response: Artist Narratives

![Vera Molnar's 'Letters from My Mother'](img/molnar_letters.jpg)

*(45 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

* Briefly **skim** the five short artist narratives below, and **choose** one artist's article to focus on.
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-3-narratives`. 
* In your post, **write** 100–150 words responding to the questions below. **Answer** all parts concisely and concretely, please.
	1. *(Process insight)* **Describe** one specific aspect of the artist’s process that stood out to you. For example, this might include how they: begin a project, iterate over time, use constraints, decide when something is “working”, or balance control and surprise.
	2. *(Decision-making)* **Identify** one decision the artist made (conceptual, aesthetic, or technical) that seems especially important to the final work. Why did this decision matter?
	3. *(Personal connection)* Briefly **describe** one way this artist’s process either: *resonates* with how you like to work, or *conflicts* with how you usually approach making things.

**Artist narratives:**

* Robert Hodgin, *Meander* (2020): [**Web**](https://roberthodgin.com/project/meander) / [PDF](pdf/hodgin_meander.pdf)
* Casey Reas, *Phototaxis* (2001-2021): [**Web**](https://medium.com/@REAS/notes-on-phototaxis-db7aa7641ad8) / [PDF](pdf/reas_phototaxis.pdf)
* Vera Molnár, *My Mother’s Letters* (1988-1995): [**PDF**](pdf/molnar-mothers-letters.pdf)
* Zach Lieberman, *Daily Sketches in 2025* (2025) [**Web**](https://zachlieberman.medium.com/daily-sketching-in-2025-60189ffd6b60) / [PDF](pdf/lieberman_2025.pdf)

## 2.4. Reading-Response: Effective Complexity and The Oatmeal Problem

![Kate Compton](img/compton.png)

*(45 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

* **Read** [this one-page excerpt from an article](pdf/kate-compton-oatmeal.pdf) from an article by Kate Compton, “So you want to build a generator...” (2016), in which she discusses the challenge of aesthetics in generative art, and introduces what she calls the "10,000 bowls of oatmeal problem". 
* **Read** [this one-page excerpt from an article](pdf/galanter_effective_complexity.pdf) by Philip Galanter, "Generative Art Theory" (2003), in which he discusses the concept of "effective complexity".
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-4-oatmeal`, and **respond** to both questions below (in about 150 words total): 
  1. *(Critical synthesis)* In your own words, **explain** why a generator that produces endless novelty can still feel boring. Use Compton’s "10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal" problem and/or Galanter’s concept of effective complexity to support your explanation.
  2. *(Constructive reflection)* **Describe** something you personally find endlessly fascinating despite (or because of) small variations. This could be a natural phenomenon, a specific cultural expression, something visual, sonic, etc. Explain what kinds of variation matter and why they remain perceptually meaningful rather than collapsing into "oatmeal."
