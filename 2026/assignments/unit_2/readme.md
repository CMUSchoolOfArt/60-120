## 2.2. Looking Outwards: Generative Art

![William Mapan (detail)](img/mapan.jpg)

*(45 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

> *“Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.”* — Philip Galanter

In this exercise, you'll look at some artworks, and make a brief post about one that caught your eye. *So:* 

* [**Here is a list**](some_generative_artworks.md) of about 50 generative artworks. **Browse** these pages, and **select** a project you like (or which appeals to you more than the others). 
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-2-looking-outwards`. In your post,
* **state** the project's title and artist;
* **provide** a link to the project's URL;
* **write** a sentence or two about what you found interesting about it; and
* **include** an image or screenshot of the artwork.

## 2.3. Reading-Response: Artist Narratives

![Vera Molnar's 'Letters from My Mother'](img/molnar_letters.jpg)

*(45 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

* Briefly **skim** the five short artist narratives below, and **choose** one artist's article to focus on.
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-3-narratives`. 
* In your post, **write** 100–150 words responding to the questions below. **Answer** all parts concisely and concretely, please.
	1. *(Process insight)* **Describe** one specific aspect of the artist’s process that stood out to you. For example, this might include how they: begin a project, iterate over time, use constraints, decide when something is “working”, or balance control and surprise.
	2. *(Decision-making)* **Identify** one decision the artist made (conceptual, aesthetic, or technical) that seems especially important to the final work. Why did this decision matter?
	3. *(Personal connection)* Briefly **describe** one way this artist’s process either: *resonates* with how you like to work, or *conflicts* with how you usually approach making things.

**Artist narratives:**

## 2.4. Reading-Response: Effective Complexity and The Oatmeal Problem

![Kate Compton](img/compton.png)

*(45 minutes; Due Monday 2/9 or Tuesday 2/10)*

* **Read** [this one-page excerpt from an article](pdf/kate-compton-oatmeal.pdf) from an article by Kate Compton, “So you want to build a generator...” (2016), in which she discusses the challenge of aesthetics in generative art, and introduces what she calls the "10,000 bowls of oatmeal problem". 
* **Read** [this one-page excerpt from an article](pdf/galanter_effective_complexity.pdf) by Philip Galanter, "Generative Art Theory" (2003), in which he discusses the concept of "effective complexity".
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-4-oatmeal`, and **respond** to both questions below (in about 150 words total): 
  1. *(Critical synthesis)* In your own words, **explain** why a generator that produces endless novelty can still feel boring. Use Compton’s "10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal" problem and/or Galanter’s concept of effective complexity to support your explanation.
  2. *(Constructive reflection)* **Describe** something you personally find endlessly fascinating despite (or because of) small variations. This could be a natural phenomenon, a specific cultural expression, something visual, sonic, etc. Explain what kinds of variation matter and why they remain perceptually meaningful rather than collapsing into "oatmeal."

## 2.6. Face Generator

This is an exercise in *procedural character design*. 

*(Recommended due date: Thursday 2/13. ~2.5 hours)*

Consider the following:

![chernoff.png](img/chernoff.png)<br />Herman Chernoff’s [multivariate face visualizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face) (1973) — displays of multivariate data in the shape of a human face, whose individual parts represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation.

![mark_wilson_metaface_dwg_w_comp_p18.png](img/mark_wilson_metaface_dwg_w_comp_p18.png)

*Now:* 

* In [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/class/104705#/), **create** a p5.js sketch whose canvas is no larger than 600x600 pixels.
* **Write** code to design an image of a face or character that is parameterized by at least three variables, but preferably more. Using the recommended code structure below, your sketch should generate a new face whenever the user clicks the mouse button. 
* **Upload** your project to the correct [OpenProcessing collection](https://openprocessing.org/class/104705/#/c/105113).
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel, `#2-6-face-generator`.
* In your post, **upload** a couple of screenshots, showing your generator's variety.
* **Write** a sentence to describe your approach, or to direct our attention.

In your project, you might have variables that specify the size, position, color, or other visual characteristics of the eyes, nose, and mouth. By randomizing these values, you could vary properties like: the face’s expression (happy, sad, angry); the face’s identity (Chris, Pat, Alex, Sam); or the face’s species (cat, monkey, zombie, alien). These are just examples.

Give special consideration to controlling the precise **shape** of face parts, such as the curves of the nose, chin, ears, and jowls, and/or characteristics such as skin color, stubble, hairstyle, blemishes, inter-pupillary distance, facial asymmetry, cephalic index, and prognathism. Consider having both **continuous** parameters (such as variables that control the size, position, and/or color of features) and **discrete** parameters (such as variables that control the number of eyeballs, or the presence or absence of a hat).

*Place your character.* A face floating in an empty void reads as unfinished because it omits context that helps viewers interpret scale, orientation, mood, and identity. Even minimal surroundings provide visual grounding: a neck and shoulders establish anatomy and posture; a background color or shape sets contrast and emotional tone; a hint of environment can imply lighting and narrative. A little context can help you make a much more compelling character system, and it does so with very little extra code.

We recommend you begin with the code template provided below. The particular structure of this code will allow your sketch to generate a new face whenever the user clicks the mouse button.


```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
}

function draw() {
  background('white'); 
  // generate a face HERE...
  noLoop();
}

function mousePressed(){
  loop();
}
```

*Please do not use an LLM to write this code for you. LLMs will make generic faces; we are interested in eliciting your own creative work, no matter how basic your skills are.*

Below are some faces by Bruno Munari. Observe how they are simple yet interesting.
