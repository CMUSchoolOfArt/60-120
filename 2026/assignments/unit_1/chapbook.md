## Steps for Working with the Lulu.com *Interior* Template

1. On your laptop, with a wide browser window open, navigate to **[https://www.lulu.com/pricing](https://www.lulu.com/pricing)**. 
2. Select "Comic Book" (6.625"x10.25"):<br/>![lulu_comic_book_choice](resources/lulu_comic_book_choice.jpg)
3. For "Book Size & Page Count", enter a number between **4-30**. *(You can change this later as long as it's in this range.)*
4. For "Binding Type", choose **Saddle Stitch**.
5. For "Interior Color", choose **Premium Color** (unless you want B&W). 
6. For "Paper Type", choose **White — 70# Coated**.
7. For "Cover Finish", I recommend **Glossy** (unless you're certain you want Matte).
8. At this point you can now **download your book template**. <br />Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Book Templates" and "Custom Cover Template":<br />![lulu_book_template_download](resources/lulu_book_template_download.png)<br />This will cause the following files to download: 
  * `cover_template.pdf`  * `lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip`
  * Later on, Here is a [revised cover template](resources/2026/lulu-comic-book-saddle-stitch-cover-template.indd.zip) (2024) that may be helpful when you lay out the cover. 
9. **Unzip** (uncompress) the `lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip` archive, probably by double-clicking on it. You'll get a folder called `lulu-book-template-comic-book`. 
10. Inside, **locate** the Adobe InDesign (.indd) file:<br />`Interior Templates/InDesign Spreads/lulu-comic-interior-template-spread.indd`. This is your template file. 
11. **Create** a new folder called `myname_book` or something similar. **Make a copy** of the `.indd` InDesign template file, **place** it in this folder, and **rename** it to something like `myname_book.indd`.
12. Inside your `myname_book` folder, **create** another folder called `images`, and **drag** all of your image assets in there. It should look something like this:<br />![lulu_files_1](resources/lulu_files_1.png). 
13. **Open** your `myname_book.indd` file in InDesign. We will now start editing it. I'm using AdobeIndesign 2026 (v.21.1).
15. I recommend you **enable** `View > Guides & Grids > Show Document Grid` and `Snap to Document Grid`.
16. Begin by **editing** your main page Parents. At the top of your Pages palette, **locate** the `PG-Page` Parent. **Modify** this page as you see fit. Changes you make will show up in all pages that use this page Parent. For example, I like to to add some guides, a text box, and an image Frame.
16. **Navigate** to one of your pages, and **drag** in an image. You can resize your image by holding down *Shift*. If it looks cropped, don't worry; you can fix this by right-clicking on the image and selecting `Fitting > Fit Content to Frame`.
17. If you'd like to add text to a text-box that is defined in a page Parent, you can do so with `Cmd + Shift + Click` (mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + Click` (win).
17. To add pages using the Pages menu, **go** to the Pages palette, **open** the tiny Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and **click** "Insert Pages".
17. If you use *full bleed* on your book (i.e., when you want ink to go all the way to the edges), make sure that your design goes *past* the edge of the page, and make sure you set a Bleed of 0.125 when you export the file. Otherwise, Lulu may complain that your document is the wrong size, or you might see white edges on your pages.
18. **Note** that you will export the interior and exterior of your book as separate PDF files! 
19. Before exporting your print-ready PDFs, **go** to the Layers palette and **delete** the Template Guides and Notes layers.20. **Export** your book's ***interior*** as a *single, multi-page PDF (not spreads!) with bleed.*

## Working with the *Cover* Template

*Eventually you will have 2 PDFs that get uploaded to Lulu.com: an interior PDF, and a cover PDF. The cover requires a separate workflow from the interior of your book.*

1. Instead of using Lulu's cover template PDF (which doesn't load cleanly into InDesign), I recommend instead using this [**simpler cover template we have prepared just for you**](resources/2026/lulu-comic-book-saddle-stitch-cover-template.indd.zip) (`lulu-comic-book-saddle-stitch-cover-template.indd.zip`). **Download** and **unzip** this `.indd` file, **make** a clean backup copy if you like, and **open** it in InDesign. 
2. **Design** your cover! **Consider** making attractive [endpapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpaper) (also called *end leaves*) which are thematically related to your book's content.
3. When it's time to export your book's *cover*, **make sure** you have [Export As Spreads](resources/export.png) checked. Do: `File->Export->`; `Format: Adobe PDF (Print)`; Save; `Export As: **Spreads**` (NOT PAGES!); `Compression: image quality maximum, do not downsample.`
