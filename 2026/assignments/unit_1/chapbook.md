## Steps

1. On your laptop, with a wide browser window open, navigate to **[https://www.lulu.com/pricing](https://www.lulu.com/pricing)**. 
2. Select "Comic Book" (6.625"x10.25"):<br/>![lulu_comic_book_choice](resources/lulu_comic_book_choice.jpg)
3. For "Book Size & Page Count", enter a number between **4-30**. *(You can change this later as long as it's in this range.)*
4. For "Binding Type", choose **Saddle Stitch**.
5. For "Interior Color", choose **Premium Color** (unless you want B&W). 
6. For "Paper Type", choose **White — 70# Coated**.
7. For "Cover Finish", I recommend **Glossy** (unless you're certain you want Matte).
8. At this point you can now **download your book template**. <br />Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Book Templates" and "Custom Cover Template":<br />![lulu_book_template_download](resources/lulu_book_template_download.png)<br />This will cause the following files to download: 
  * `cover_template.pdf`  * `lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip`
  * FWIW, Here is a [revised cover template](resources/2026/lulu-comic-book-saddle-stitch-cover-template.indd.zip) (2024) that may be helpful when you lay out the cover. 
9. **Unzip** (uncompress) the `lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip` archive, probably by double-clicking on it. You'll get a folder called `lulu-book-template-comic-book`. 
10. Inside, **locate** the Adobe InDesign (.indd) file:<br />`Interior Templates/InDesign Spreads/lulu-comic-interior-template-spread.indd`. This is your template file. 
11. **Create** a new folder called `myname_book` or something similar. **Make a copy** of the `.indd` InDesign template file, **place** it in this folder, and **rename** it to something like `myname_book.indd`.
12. Inside your `myname_book` folder, **create** another folder called `images`, and **drag** all of your image assets in there. It should look something like this:<br />![lulu_files_1](resources/lulu_files_1.png). 
13. **Open** your `myname_book.indd` file in InDesign. We will now start editing it. I'm using AdobeIndesign 2026 (v.21.1).
15. I recommend you **enable** `View > Guides & Grids > Show Document Grid` and `Snap to Document Grid`.
16. Begin by **editing** your main page Parents. At the top of your Pages palette, **locate** the `PG-Page` Parent. **Modify** this page as you see fit. Changes you make will show up in all pages that use this page Parent. For example, I like to to add some guides, a text box, and an image Frame.
16. **Navigate** to one of your pages, and **drag** in an image. You can resize your image by holding down *Shift*. If it looks cropped, don't worry; you can fix this by right-clicking on the image and selecting `Fitting > Fit Content to Frame`.
17. If you'd like to add text to a text-box that is defined in a page Parent, you can do so with `Cmd + Shift + Click` (mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + Click` (win).
17. To add pages using the Pages menu, **go** to the Pages palette, **open** the tiny Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and **click** "Insert Pages".
17. If you use *full bleed* on your book (i.e., if you want ink to go all the way to the edges), make sure that your design goes past the edge of the page, and make sure you set a Bleed of 0.125 when you export the file. Otherwise, Lulu may complain that your document is the wrong size.
18. **Note** that you will export the interior and exterior of your book as separate PDF files! 
19. Before exporting your print-ready PDFs, **go** to the Layers palette and **delete** the Template Guides and Notes layers.20. **Export** your book's *interior* as a *single, multi-page PDF (not spreads!) with bleed.*
21. However, when you export your book's *cover*, make sure you have [Export As Spreads](resources/export.png) checked.
