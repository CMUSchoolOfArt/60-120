### What We’re Doing and Why

(6-10 hours, due W/R Jan 28/29). Your challenge is to use generative AI to assist you in the creation of an illustrated book, and to self-publish this book through Lulu.com, an online vendor. Why are we doing this?

(Ab)using AI creatively requires a very different way of thinking. We feel you should develop an understanding of the grain and possibilities of this new medium, and that you should have the skill to guide AI systems to produce compelling cultural objects. Everyday people like [this guy](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-midjourney-ai-write-illustrate-childrens-book-one-weekend-alice-2023-1) are using AI to make stuff that superficially ‘looks good’; as an artist, you really ought to be better than them.

You will need to use Adobe InDesign to layout the book, and you will need to navigate Lulu.com’s system for self-publishing. While your work with Midjourney may be highly conceptual and experimental, your work with InDesign and the online digital publishing process will be bluntly practical.

Our goal is to explore the potential of these tools as assistants or prosthetics for your creativity. For this reason, you are invited/permitted to hand-edit the texts and or images that you generate, in any way you deem necessary.

You are asked to consider a distinct narrative point of view, with a specific audience in mind. The goal is to see if it is possible to make something which is not slop. Some possibilities for what your book could be include: 

* Retelling a dream
* A personal anecdote or memory; an illustrated diary entry
* A story about something that happened to a family member
* A gift for a specific person


### How You Will Do It

Your book may be: all images, or any mixture of text and images. To generate images, you are encouraged to use MidJourney, but you may use another tool (ChatGPT, Google Nano Banana, RunwayML, etc.) if you prefer. **NOTE:** To make your book look good, you’ll need to generate images in the highest resolution possible, either using Midjourney’s or Runway’s “Upscale” feature, or a superresolution AI upscaling tool like Waifu2x or Remini.

We will use the Lulu.com “Comic Book” template for InDesign. Download this template (lulu-comic-book-interior-template.indd inside the lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip folder) by navigating through this form here. Select “Comic Book” and (for books between 2-32 pages) the “saddle stitch” binding. You may print in color or black-and-white, up to you. Your book may have up to 32 pages. Here are some important pain points to note about using Lulu’s templates:

When you first open it, Lulu’s file templates default to having the workspace set to the locked “Template” layer—and you literally won’t be able to do or accomplish anything. This is very frustrating. Go to the Layers menu and switch your active layer to the unlocked layer called “Your Artwork”.

For some infuriating reason, Lulu’s template comes with all typography set to “All Caps”. This means that no matter what text you type or paste, it LOOKS LIKE THIS. Fix this by going to Window→Type&Tables→Character palette, open the Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and unclick the “All Caps” checkbox.

The Lulu template comes with the default font being “Open Sans”. If you don’t happen to have this font on your system, then all the text you try to display will be highlighted pink, indicating an error status (i.e. missing font). Choose a different font in the Character menu.

To add pages using the Pages menu, go to the Pages palette, open the tiny Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and enable “Allow Document Pages to Shuffle”.
I strongly suggest that you go File→DocumentSetup→Enable Facing Pages. This will help make it clear which page is on the left or right side of your book’s spreads.
Here is a revised cover template (2024) that will be helpful when you lay out the cover.
When you export the cover, make sure you have Export As Spreads checked.

If you use full bleed on your book (meaning, you want ink to go all the way to the edges), make sure that your design goes past the edge of the page, and make sure you set a Bleed of 0.125 when you export the file. Otherwise, Lulu will complain that your document is the wrong size.

### What are the Actual Deliverables?

(I have presented an example of these deliverables on Lulu here, in PDF here, and on this page.)

*Now:*

* Be prepared to **discuss** a proposal for your project in class on 1/X; see #1.X: Project Proposal above.
* **Make** a book with AI-generated images, with up to 32 pages, and publish this on Lulu.com using their “Comic Book” printed format.
* **Create** a Discord post, in the `#1-x-chapbook` channel.
* In your post, **begin** by providing a single sentence declaring the title of your book, and briefly describing what your book “is”.
* **Write** a few sentences describing what inspired or motivated you to make this particular idea. What were you aiming for? How did your thinking evolve? Discuss your process.
* **Write** a couple sentences of critical evaluation. Which specific aspects of your project do you feel proud of, and which aspects fell short of your vision?
* **Provide** a screenshot of a “contact sheet” of the interior of your book, showing all of the pages. (You can do this using Preview or Acrobat.)
* **Include** a link to your book, published at Lulu.com. **Ensure** this link is working. Your book *must* be publicly purchasable from Lulu.com, at the cost of production.
* **Store** a PDF copy of your book’s interior and cover in your CMU Google drive. In your Discord post, include links to these PDF files. Make sure these links have ‘public viewing’ enabled.
* **Present** your project in a class critique on Thursday, January 2x. You’ll present it digitally, from a PDF stored in your CMU Google Drive.
