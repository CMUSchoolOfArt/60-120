![chapbooks_2023.jpg](resources/chapbooks_2023.jpg)

The first unit in this course is concerned with the personal, creative, and critical use of “AI” tools for generating imagery. In order for you to develop an understanding of the “grain” of this medium, you will be asked to use generative AI tools like MidJourney to produce an illustrated monograph or chapbook. You will then lay out your book using Adobe InDesign, and physically produce your book using Lulu.com, an online print-on-demand service — a publication method of great practical value.

The use of generative AI tools in arts pedagogy is new, poorly understood, and controversial. This project engages art students with experimental tools that are new, changing quickly, optimized for 'slop', and whose very existence is fraught with new forms of potential infringement and abuse. Our hope is that this exercise will not only be instructive in the aesthetics and mechanics of using these new technologies, but in their ethics as well.

## 1-4-image-generation

**(60 minutes, due T/W Jan 20/21)**

In this exercise, you will use a machine learning system to generate some images that intrigue you. This system has (controversially) been trained on billions of images scraped from the Internet. This very entertaining [*Last Week Tonight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWpg1RmzAbc) video gives some good perspective; I encourage you to watch it.


You have been provided with access to a paid account for MidJourney, an image synthesis service. Login details for this account are available in the `key-information` channel of our course Discord. **NOTE**: These Discord/Midjourney accounts are a communally shared resource for the students in our class, and sharing it with you is an act of trust.

* *In Discord account (bottom left); →Switch accounts; →Add an account; →Email or Phone number: art-software-1@andrew.cmu.edu or art-software-2@andrew.cmu.edu; →Use password from the `key-information` channel on Discord.* 

*Now,*

* **Read** the [**Midjourney Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/33329261836941-Getting-Started-Guide) — most especially, the [**"Parameter List" documentation**](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32859204029709-Parameter-List). These parameters allow you to control the image aspect ratio, resolution, visual quality, inspiration source image, and (importantly) choice of AI model.
* **Tinker!** Try experimenting with techniques like: “inspiring” an image with a seed image, using different model versions, making non-square images, etcetera.
* **Research** tips for generating good prompts; there are many guides online. (Text-based LLMs like ChatGPT may also be helpful for this.)
* **Generate** a half-dozen or so images, and present them in the Discord post. What you make is up to you, but we challenge you to make something *as weird as possible*. Try to work a prompt through at least 5 iterations of revision.
* **Create** a Discord post in the channel `1-4-image-generation`
* **Embed** your images in the post.
* For each image, **include** the text of the prompt that you used to create it.
* **Write** a few sentences of reflective commentary. What discoveries did you make? Were you able to ‘guide’ the system? 


***In using our communal Midjourney (Discord) account, please adhere to the following:***

* I’ll need to help you log in the first time by affirming that your login is legit.
* Do not share the login details of this account with anyone.
* Do not modify any of the account settings (password, etc.)!
* Do not use this account to connect to any other Discord servers.
* Do not use this account to communicate with other people on Discord, harass them, etc. 
* You must adhere to our course Code of Conduct.
* You must adhere to the MidJourney terms of service. If you get booted off for doing bad things (like generating offensive content), it affects our whole class.

**(10-12 hours, due M/T Feb 02/03)**

### What We’re Doing and Why

You are invited to use generative AI to assist you in the creation of an illustrated monograph or chapbook, and to self-publish this book through Lulu.com, an online vendor. 

You are asked to consider a distinct narrative point of view, with a specific audience in mind. Your challenge — *THE* challenge — is to see if it is possible to make something which is not slop. Some possibilities for what your book could be, include: 

* Retelling a dream
* An illustrated diary entry, personal anecdote, or memory
* A story about something that happened to a family member
* A gift for a specific person

*Why are we doing this?* (Ab)using AI creatively requires a very different way of thinking. We feel you should develop an understanding of the grain and possibilities of this new medium, and that you should have the skill to guide AI systems to produce compelling cultural objects. Everyday people like [this guy](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-midjourney-ai-write-illustrate-childrens-book-one-weekend-alice-2023-1) are using AI to make stuff that superficially ‘looks good’; as an artist, you really ought to be able to do better than them.

You are asked to use Adobe InDesign to layout the book, and you will need to navigate Lulu.com’s system for self-publishing. While your work with the MidJourney image generator may be highly conceptual and experimental, your work with the InDesign layout software and the online digital publishing process will be bluntly practical.

Our goal is to explore the potential of these tools as assistants or prosthetics for your creativity. For this reason, you are invited/permitted to hand-edit the images that you generate, in any way you deem necessary.


### How You Will Do It

Your book may consist exclusively of images, or it can be any mixture of text and images. To generate images, you are encouraged to use MidJourney, but you may use another AI tool (ChatGPT, Google Nano Banana, RunwayML, etc.) if you prefer. **NOTE:** To make your book look good, you’ll need to generate images in the highest resolution possible, either using MidJourney’s or Runway’s “Upscale” feature, or some other superresolution AI upscaling tool like Waifu2x or Remini.

We will use Lulu.com's “Comic Book” template for InDesign. Your book may have up to 32 pages. Download this template (`lulu-comic-book-interior-template.indd` inside the `lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip` folder) by navigating through [this form here](https://www.lulu.com/pricing). Select “Comic Book” and the “saddle stitch” binding (because your book has 32 or fewer pages). You may print in color or black-and-white, this is up to you. Here are some important pain points to note about using Lulu’s templates:

* When you first open it, Lulu’s file templates default to having the workspace set to the locked “Template” layer—and you literally won’t be able to do or accomplish anything. This is very frustrating. Go to the Layers menu and switch your active layer to the unlocked layer called “Your Artwork”. 
* For some infuriating reason, Lulu’s template comes with all typography set to “All Caps”. This means that no matter what text you type or paste, it LOOKS LIKE THIS. You can fix this by going to Window→Type&Tables→Character palette, open the Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and unclick the “All Caps” checkbox.
* The Lulu template comes with the default font being “Open Sans”. If you don’t happen to have this font on your system, then all the text you try to display will be highlighted pink, indicating an error status (i.e. missing font). Choose a different font in the Character menu.
* To add pages using the Pages menu, go to the Pages palette, open the tiny Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and enable “Allow Document Pages to Shuffle”.
* We *strongly* suggest that you go File→DocumentSetup→Enable Facing Pages. This will help make it clear which page is on the left or right side of your book’s spreads. Here is a [revised cover template](resources/lulu-comic-book-saddle-stitch-cover-template.indd.zip) (2024) that will be helpful when you lay out the cover. 
* When you export the cover, make sure you have [Export As Spreads](resources/export.png) checked.
* If you use *full bleed* on your book (meaning, you want ink to go all the way to the edges), make sure that your design goes past the edge of the page, and make sure you set a Bleed of 0.125 when you export the file. Otherwise, Lulu will complain that your document is the wrong size.

### What are the Actual Deliverables?

We have presented an example of these deliverables [on Lulu here](https://www.lulu.com/shop/golan-levin/an-abecedarium-of-dwellings/paperback/product-pp7ne7.html?page=1&pageSize=4), in PDF here ([cover](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K1yetUrnYgXXIdfjdpdN36gRBuxH1Uq2/view?usp=sharing) / [interior](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvZ0n5JRtLPRpwqJemdm7BT7UIC7mmpP/view?usp=sharing
)), and [on this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20241011014238/https://golancourses.net/60120/deliverables/1-aiart/sample-project-1/).

*Now:*

* **Make** a book with AI-generated images, with up to 32 pages, and publish this on Lulu.com using their “Comic Book” (6x9) printed format.
* **Create** a Discord post, in the `#1-7-monograph` channel.
* In your Discord post, **begin** by providing a single sentence declaring the title of your book, and briefly describing what your book “is”.
* **Write** a few sentences describing what inspired or motivated you to make this particular idea. What were you aiming for? How did your thinking evolve? Discuss your process.
* **Write** a couple sentences of critical evaluation. Which specific aspects of your project do you feel proud of, and which aspects fell short of your vision?
* **Provide** a screenshot of a “contact sheet” of the interior of your book, showing all of the pages. (You can do this using Preview or Acrobat.)
* **Include** a link to your book, published at Lulu.com. **Ensure** this link is working. Your book *must* be publicly purchasable from Lulu.com, at the cost of production.
* **Store** a PDF copy of your book’s interior and cover in your CMU Google drive. In your Discord post, include links to these PDF files. Make sure these links have ‘public viewing’ enabled.
* **Present** your project in a class critique on February 02/03. You’ll present it digitally, from a PDF stored in your CMU Google Drive.
