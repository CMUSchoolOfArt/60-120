![chapbooks_2023.jpg](resources/chapbooks_2023.jpg)

The first unit in this course is concerned with the personal, creative, and critical use of “AI” tools for generating imagery. In order for you to develop an understanding of the “grain” of this medium, you will be asked to use generative AI tools like MidJourney to produce an illustrated monograph or chapbook. You will then lay out your book using Adobe InDesign, and physically produce your book using Lulu.com, an online print-on-demand service — a publication method of great practical value.

The use of generative AI tools in arts pedagogy is new, poorly understood, and controversial. This project engages art students with experimental tools that are new, changing quickly, optimized for 'slop', and whose very existence is fraught with new forms of potential infringement and abuse. Our hope is that this exercise will not only be instructive in the aesthetics and mechanics of using these new technologies, but in their ethics as well.

## 1-4-wrong-things

> In this exercise we will use Midjourney to explore failure modes of generative AI.

[![diving.jpg](resources/diving.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnyJ-BidzIg)

**(45 minutes, due T/W Jan 20/21)**

Let's talk about *failure*. **Watch** this [90-second video of AI Diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnyJ-BidzIg), and **consider** this quote from Brian Eno, which is often cited in discussions about creativity and technology:

> *"Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of video, the crap sound of 8-bit—all these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided."*

Eno's premise is that the imperfections or "glitches" of a medium, which may initially be seen as flaws, often become celebrated characteristics that define its aesthetic and cultural significance. In our present case, we can see that the way AI fails may be exactly what is, frankly, *interesting* about it. One of [these videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThatsInsane/comments/1jyja0s/2_years_difference_makes_you_wonder_where_ai_will/) is memorable, and the other is... not. We see the world in new ways, when we see how a machine has failed to know it as we do. 

In this exercise, you will experiment with MidJourney to identify something that the AI has a difficult time representing. (You may find it helpful to explore some of the older versions of the MidJourney models, which you can access with the `--version` command.) **Generate** at least 3 images that show the glitches or failures you have discovered.

You have been provided with access to a paid account for MidJourney, an image synthesis service. Login details for this account are available in the `key-information` channel of our course Discord. **NOTE**: These Discord/Midjourney accounts are a communally shared resource for the students in our class, and sharing it with you is an act of trust. **Instructions:**

* *In Discord account (bottom left); →Switch accounts; →Add an account; →Email or Phone number: art-software-1@andrew.cmu.edu or art-software-2@andrew.cmu.edu; →Use password from the `key-information` channel on Discord.* 

*Now,*

* **Read** the [**Midjourney Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/33329261836941-Getting-Started-Guide) — most especially, the [**"Parameter List" documentation**](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32859204029709-Parameter-List). These parameters allow you to control the image aspect ratio, resolution, visual quality, inspiration source image, and (importantly) choice of AI model.
* **Tinker!** Try experimenting with techniques like: “inspiring” an image with a seed image, using different model versions, making non-square images, etcetera.
* **Research** tips for generating good prompts; there are many guides online. (AI systems like ChatGPT could also be helpful for this.)
* **Generate** at least 3 different images to explore the way the AI fails. For each of these ideas, **revise** your prompt through at least 3 iterations.
* **Create** a Discord post in the channel `1-4-wrong-things`
* **Embed** your images in the post.
* For each image, **include** the text of the prompt that you used to create it.
* **Write** a few sentences of reflective commentary. What failures did you discover? Were you eventually able to ‘guide’ the system around them? 


***In using our communal Midjourney (Discord) account, please adhere to the following:***

* I’ll need to help you log in the first time by affirming that your login is legit.
* Do not share the login details of this account with anyone.
* Do not modify any of the account settings (password, etc.)!
* Do not use this account to connect to any other Discord servers.
* Do not use this account to communicate with other people on Discord, harass them, etc. 
* You must adhere to our course Code of Conduct.
* You must adhere to the MidJourney terms of service. If you get booted off for doing bad things (like generating offensive content), it affects our whole class.
* **Please do not generate video;** it will use up our shared credits.

## 1-5-image-generation

**(45 minutes, due T/W Jan 20/21)**

> In this exercise we will use RunwayML to explore additional imaging techniques in a more self-directed way.

![runway_outpainting.jpg](resources/runway_outpainting.jpg)

In the `key-information` Discord channel, you have been provided with credentials to access [Runway.ML](https://app.runwayml.com/), a powerful suite of machine-learning-based artist tools. Runway.ML changes their tools *often*, to keep up with quickly-changing developments in AI tooling. Your job in this exercise is to experiment with their current offerings, and report back on your discoveries.

Use one of Runway's many imaging tools to generate or manipulate an image of your choice. For example, you could explore their **Expand** tool, which performs "outpainting" (expanding the area beyond the borders of an image you provide), as shown in the cat image above. Or you could explore some of the other imaging models that Runway makes available, such as Google's *Nano Banana*. 

**PLEASE DO NOT GENERATE VIDEO.** Doing so risks using up all of our (shared) account credits. 

*Now:*

* **Create** a Discord post in the channel `#1-5-image-generation`, and embed your result(s).
* If you did modify an existing image, then please also **embed** the “original” image that you extended, so we can better understand what you did.
* **Write** a few sentences describing your process. What did you discover? 
* **Write** a few sentences of reflective commentary. What do you appreciate about the result, and what would you change?

---

## 1-6-proposal

**(20 minutes, due R/M Jan 22/26).**

The purpose of this sub-assignment is to keep you on track.

* **Read** ahead to the prompt for the Book Project (`1-7-chapbook`), below.
* Take a few minutes to **browse** some of the artist books discussed in [this video playlist, *Artist's Books Unshelved*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHwzS6Uhxef6LYVrKCrZ9FYriOI8fixYU).
* **Create** a Discord post in the channel, `#1-6-proposal`.
* **Write** a sentence or two that describes, in broad terms, the book you plan to create for this project. Optionally, please free to share some early imaging results, or a brief update about your progress on the project (if any).

## 1-7-monograph

**(10-12 hours, due M/T Feb 02/03)**

### What We’re Doing and Why

You are invited to use generative AI to assist you in the creation of an illustrated monograph or chapbook, and to self-publish this book through Lulu.com, an online vendor. 

You are asked to consider a distinct narrative point of view, with a specific audience in mind. Your challenge — *THE* challenge — is to see if it is possible to make something which is not slop. Some possibilities for what your book could be, include: 

* Retelling a dream
* An illustrated diary entry, personal anecdote, or memory
* A story about something that happened to a family member
* A gift for a specific person

*Why are we doing this?* (Ab)using AI creatively requires a very different way of thinking. We feel you should develop an understanding of the grain and possibilities of this new medium, and that you should have the skill to guide AI systems to produce compelling cultural objects. Everyday people like [this guy](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-midjourney-ai-write-illustrate-childrens-book-one-weekend-alice-2023-1) are using AI to make stuff that superficially ‘looks good’; as an artist, you really ought to be able to do better than them.

You are asked to use Adobe InDesign to layout the book, and you will need to navigate Lulu.com’s system for self-publishing. While your work with the MidJourney image generator may be highly conceptual and experimental, your work with the InDesign layout software and the online digital publishing process will be bluntly practical.

Our goal is to explore the potential of these tools as assistants or prosthetics for your creativity. For this reason, you are invited/permitted to hand-edit the images that you generate, in any way you deem necessary.


### How You Will Do It

Your book may consist exclusively of images, or it can be any mixture of text and images. To generate images, you are encouraged to use MidJourney, but you may use another AI tool (ChatGPT, Google Nano Banana, RunwayML, etc.) if you prefer. **NOTE:** To make your book look good, you’ll need to generate images in the highest resolution possible, either using MidJourney’s or Runway’s “Upscale” feature, or some other superresolution AI upscaling tool like Waifu2x or Remini.

We will use Lulu.com's “Comic Book” template for InDesign. Your book may have up to 30 pages. [**Instructions for obtaining and working with the Lulu.com InDesign templates are here.**](chapbook.md).


<!-- 

// OLD (2023) 

Download this template (`lulu-comic-book-interior-template.indd` inside the `lulu-book-template-comic-book.zip` folder) by navigating through [this form here](https://www.lulu.com/pricing). Select “Comic Book” and the “saddle stitch” binding (because your book has 30 or fewer pages). You may print in color or black-and-white, this is up to you. Here are some important pain points to note about using Lulu’s templates:

* When you first open it, Lulu’s file templates default to having the workspace set to the locked “Template” layer—and you literally won’t be able to do or accomplish anything. This is very frustrating. Go to the Layers menu and switch your active layer to the unlocked layer called “Your Artwork”. 
* For some infuriating reason, Lulu’s template comes with all typography set to “All Caps”. This means that no matter what text you type or paste, it LOOKS LIKE THIS. You can fix this by going to Window→Type&Tables→Character palette, open the Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and unclick the “All Caps” checkbox.
* The Lulu template comes with the default font being “Open Sans”. If you don’t happen to have this font on your system, then all the text you try to display will be highlighted pink, indicating an error status (i.e. missing font). Choose a different font in the Character menu.
* To add pages using the Pages menu, go to the Pages palette, open the tiny Options hamburger menu in the upper right, and enable “Allow Document Pages to Shuffle”.
* We *strongly* suggest that you go File→DocumentSetup→Enable Facing Pages. This will help make it clear which page is on the left or right side of your book’s spreads. Here is a [revised cover template](resources/2026/lulu-comic-book-saddle-stitch-cover-template.indd.zip) (2024) that will be helpful when you lay out the cover. 
* When you export the cover, make sure you have [Export As Spreads](resources/export.png) checked.
* If you use *full bleed* on your book (meaning, you want ink to go all the way to the edges), make sure that your design goes past the edge of the page, and make sure you set a Bleed of 0.125 when you export the file. Otherwise, Lulu will complain that your document is the wrong size.
