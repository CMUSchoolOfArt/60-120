### Reading Discussion 

You were assigned one of the following three readings about generative AI: 

1. [Francesco D'Isa: "The Idea of AI Slop Is Slop" (2025)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_meAeg9p5-WrP3diZgjWTs2q5HNPG0nr/view?usp=drive_link)
2. [Maria Popova: "Nick Cave on AI, Awe, and the Splendor of Our Human Limitations" (2019)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnSgBM7_7-5aDMDoTGwwtmIi-r3NX4VJ/view?usp=drive_link) 
3. [Eryk Salvaggio: "Slop Infrastructures 1 & 2" (2024)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_aDHirFQaNQoI6mnzsYUdJDZWIDsQ0BP/view?usp=sharing)

In groups of ~6 students, meet to discuss these articles. As speaker, your job is to explain the article you read; as listener, your job is to make sure you understand it.
